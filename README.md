# Virtual Piano Sheets to Rubber Ducky Script Converter üéº > üìú
------------------------------------------------
‚ùóNOTICE‚ùó
--------
‚ö†Ô∏è Currently working on an application for this program, so it runs on an executable and doesnt rely on python IDE's ‚ö†Ô∏è

(This may take a while as I am teaching myself C# programming)
- I have added the basic conversion from VP sheets to ducky format, and am now working on making the app look somewhat visually pleasing. (Updated 25/11/2024)

------------------------------------------------
üìÑ  Overview 
--------
- Welcome to the Virtual Piano to Rubber Ducky Script Converter! This project provides a Python script that takes virtual piano sheets and transforms them into a Rubber Ducky script, specifically designed for use with the Flipper Zero or similar devices equipped with buttons.
- This tool converts virtual piano sheets into ducky script format to then use as the auto piano feature found in the Roblox game https://www.roblox.com/games/8848607186/Digital-Piano-Free-Auto, allowing you to play songs semi-effortlessly!
  
- This is the in-game auto piano that i am re-creating for my Flipper zero (BadUSB) ‚¨áÔ∏è

‚öôÔ∏è  Features 
--------
- Conversion: Easily convert virtual piano sheet music into a script that can be executed on your Rubber Ducky or compatible device.
- User-Friendly: Designed for users with devices that have a button interface, making it simple to perform piano pieces automatically.
- Press the button (on, in my case my flipper zero) to send a keyboard output to the piano as it works like the auto piano in the mentioned roblox game where you press a button for the next note / chord to be played eg: a b c [de] f [gh].
  
- BadUSB program (on flipper) in use (using converted virtual piano sheet) ‚¨áÔ∏è

#### (Notice how in the image above, the screen says "Press to Continue"? Thats the code that makes the Ducky file act like the auto piano in the roblox game i mentioned) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è

-------------------
‚úèÔ∏è  Getting Started 
-------------------
- Python 3.x installed on your machine (I use v3.11)
- Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts
- A Rubber Ducky (with button) or compatible device (like Flipper Zero (with BadUSB app))

-----
üíæ  Usage   ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATING ‚ö†Ô∏è
-----
- Prepare your virtual piano sheet in the required format.
- The script will generate a Rubber Ducky script that will prompt you to save to your device (as .txt)
- Execute the script on your Rubber Ducky or Flipper Zero to start playing! (using the button to play each line)

‚ÑπÔ∏è  Extra Info
-------------
- In no way will this get you banned (talking of roblox) as a BadUSB is just a device imitating a keyboard button press.
- I made this just as a little side project for myself, and decided to share it on here for others to use.
- Ducky scripts (on flipper) uses the button to proceed to the next keypress. 
- Using this over bluetooth can sometimes reset the script if you press to quickly as the flipper needs to know the keypress has been successfully sent. The process may take a few seconds/milliseconds, and during that process the flipper might say \*press button* to "Stop" (if that makes any sense?) So is best used using a USB as there is far less delay and thingns that may cause it to restart/stop. 

#### V-Pano info (about me):
- I have been playing virtual piano for a few years now.
- Some people say auto is for bad people who are incompetent with learning to actually play, but i just look past them and enjoy myself. I know how to play some songs, so thats all I care about.

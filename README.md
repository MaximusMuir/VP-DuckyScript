# Virtual Piano to Rubber Ducky Script Converter 🎼 > 📜
------------------------------------------------
📄  Overview 
--------
- Welcome to the Virtual Piano to Rubber Ducky Script Converter! This project provides a Python script that takes virtual piano sheets and transforms them into a Rubber Ducky script, specifically designed for use with the Flipper Zero or similar devices equipped with buttons.
- This tool converts virtual piano sheets into fucky script format to then use as the auto piano feature found in the Roblox game https://www.roblox.com/games/8848607186/Digital-Piano-Free-Auto, allowing you to play songs semi-effortlessly!
  
- This is the in-game auto piano that i am re-creating for my Flipper zero (BadUSB) ⬇️

⚙️  Features 
--------
- Conversion: Easily convert virtual piano sheet music into a script that can be executed on your Rubber Ducky or compatible device.
- User-Friendly: Designed for users with devices that have a button interface, making it simple to perform piano pieces automatically.
- Press the button (on, in my case my flipper zero) to send a keyboard output to the piano as it works like the auto piano in the mentioned roblox game where you press a button for the next note / chord to be played eg: a b c [de] f [gh].

✏️  Getting Started 
-------------------
- Python 3.x installed on your machine (I use v3.11)
- Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts
- A Rubber Ducky (with button) or compatible device (like Flipper Zero (with BadUSB app))

💾  Usage 
-----
- Prepare your virtual piano sheet in the required format.
- The script will generate a Rubber Ducky script that will prompt you to save to your device (as .txt)
- Execute the script on your Rubber Ducky or Flipper Zero to start playing! (using the button to play each line)

ℹ️  Extra Info
-------------
- In no way will this get you banned (talking of roblox) as a BadUSB is just a device sending keyboard button presses to your pc.
- I made this just as a little side project for myself, and decided to share it on here.
- Ducky scripts (on flipper) using the button to proceed, over bluetooth can sometimes reset the script if you press to quickly. So is best used using a USB. 

V-Pano info (about me):
- I have been playing virtual piano for a few years now.
- Some people say auto is for bad people who are incompetent with learning to actually play, but i just look past them and enjoy myself. I know how to play some songs, so thats all I care about.
